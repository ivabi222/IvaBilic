	Many of us are familiar with some form of the throbbing, uncomfortable, and distracting pain of a headache. There are different types of headaches. Where your head hurts isn't a foolproof way to diagnose the cause, but the location of your headache can be a good starting point for figuring out the root of the problem. Different types of headaches can show up in similar places though, so what it feels like will also help you narrow down a plan for how to deal with your pain and decide when to see a doctor. Common Headache Types by Location The headaches people usually get are tension headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches. Cluster headaches don't happen as often, but men are five times more likely to get them.
